A rubber duck that should answer to your scikit-learn questions. But this is just
a rubber duck, so it will only be listening to your questions and wrongly answer until
you find the solution by yourself.

This rubber duck is an implementation of a RAG model trained on the scikit-learn
documentation.

You want to refer to the following
[documentation](https://probabl-ai.github.io/sklearn-ragger-duck/install.html)
page to get started.
